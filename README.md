| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`Linked List`](https://github.com/vargas88hugo/data-algorithms/tree/master/java/com/linkedlist) | A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list. |
| [`Queue`](https://github.com/vargas88hugo/data-algorithms/tree/master/java/com/queue) | A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). |
| [`Stack`](https://github.com/vargas88hugo/data-algorithms/tree/master/java/com/stack) | A Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). | 
| [`Binary Tree`](https://github.com/vargas88hugo/data-algorithms/tree/master/java/com/binarytree) | A Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. |
